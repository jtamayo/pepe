How do I structure the code now?
- The field adapter could still work as expected, the shadow stack must be rewritten from scratch. 

- What happens with code that instruments itself? 

So ASM depends on some of the java core classes. 

Move ASM to my own root package.

Who should be implemented?

The code in my methods should not be instrumented. Nothing in my methods should be instrumented. Ah, but I depend on arraylust, etc, and those classes will be instrumented. damn. Now, is there a problem if I run against uninstrumented classes? I think not, my code should be robust enough to maintain unistrumented classes working well. 

A better idea, however, would be to keep my dependencies limited to uninstrumented classes.
